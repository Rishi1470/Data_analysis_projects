## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
- **SQL**: For querying and managing data in relational databases.
- **R**: For statistical analysis and advanced data visualization using ggplot2 and dplyr.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis was collected from various websites. You can find the dataset in each folder of the project or access it from platforms like Kaggle and Data.world.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rishisrv1470/Data_analysis_Project
   cd Data_analysis_Project

## Analysis
This section provides a brief overview of the analysis performed:

- Data Cleaning: Performed data cleaning process, including Fillna and Imputer to handle missing values, etc. on Python and R.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized the data's available in the dataset using matplotlib, Seaborn, etc..,
- Statistical Analysis: [Performed statitical test, Feature engineering and indepth analysis on the dataset. Used SQL to perform Power analysis to extract the required data from the dataset.

## Results
The key findings from the analysis include:

- Python: Handled data extraction, cleaning, and automation, while generating visualizations such as repository activity and commit frequency trends.
- R: Conducted advanced statistical analysis and produced detailed visualizations, revealing insights like language popularity trends and issue resolution times.
- SQL: Used to query dataset for repository metrics, contributor activity, and language trends, providing insights like top repositories by stars and contributor growth over time.]
Visualizations and detailed results can be found in the results/ Analysis_image.
